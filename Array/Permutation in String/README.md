# 567. Permutation In String
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.
In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.
## Solution
This code defines a class called `Solution` and implements a function `checkInclusion` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `s1` is a permutation of any substring of `s2`. Let's go through the code step by step:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  bool checkInclusion(string s1, string s2) {
    // Create a vector to store the count of each character in s1
    vector<int> count(128);
    int required = s1.length();

    // Count the occurrence of each character in s1
    for (const char c : s1)
      ++count[c];

    // Use sliding window technique to check for permutations
    for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < s2.length(); ++r) {
      if (--count[s2[r]] >= 0)
        --required;
      while (required == 0) {
        if (r - l + 1 == s1.length())
          return true;
        if (++count[s2[l++]] > 0)
          ++required;
      }
    }

    return false;
  }
};
```

Let's break down the code further:

1. The code starts by defining a class called `Solution`.

2. Inside the class, the `checkInclusion` function is declared. It takes two parameters: `s1` and `s2`, both of type `string`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether `s1` is a permutation of any substring of `s2`.

3. A vector `count` of size 128 is created to store the count of each character in `s1`. The vector is initialized with all elements set to 0.

4. The variable `required` is set to the length of `s1`. It represents the number of characters still required to match for `s1` to be a permutation of a substring of `s2`.

5. A loop is used to count the occurrence of each character in `s1`. For each character `c` in `s1`, the corresponding element in the `count` vector is incremented.

6. The code then uses the sliding window technique to check for permutations. It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to define a window in `s2`.

7. The loop iterates over the characters of `s2` from left to right. For each character `s2[r]`, the count of that character in the `count` vector is decremented. If the count is still greater than or equal to 0, it means that the character is present in `s1` and it contributes to the permutation. In such cases, the `required` count is decremented.

8. The code then enters a while loop that checks if all characters in `s1` have been matched. This is determined by the `required` variable being equal to 0. If all characters have been matched, the length of the current window (`r - l + 1`) is checked. If it is equal to the length of `s1`, it means that a permutation of `s1` has been found in `s2`, so the function returns `true`.

9. If the window size is not equal to the length of `s1`, the code advances the left pointer `l` and adjusts the `count` vector and `required` count accordingly. The character at `s2[l]` is incremented in the `count` vector, and if the count becomes greater than 0, it means that a required character has been excluded from the window, so the `required` count is incremented
